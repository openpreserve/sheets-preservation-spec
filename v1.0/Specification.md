## 1 Introduction

This document describes the considerations to make when digitally preserving data created in a spreadsheet file format (i.e. .xlsx, .numbers, .ods).

The document is formalized as a specification to be used in Archival Information Packages (AIP), ideally in parallel with bit preservation of the original data. The migration of spreadsheet data should not be conducted prior to appraisal and technical analysis to ensure data loss is reduced to a minimum and any incurred is acceptable within your organisation.

The specification should be supported by software tools to automatically process the conversion and validation of spreadsheets to comply with this specification.

This specification is released and maintained by [Open Preservation Foundation](https://openpreservation.org/).

## 2 Declarations

### 2.1 Aim

The specification is intended to define a concise and general approach to the preservation of data saved in spreadsheet file formats.

The specification defines recommended conversion paths to select file formats in order to reduce the probability of technological obsolescence and make your collections more manageable.

### 2.2 Scope

The specification defines file formats and data quality suitable for an Archival Information Package (AIP). The specification may be adopted by any preservation institution, which ingests spreadsheets and maintains a migration strategy.

### 2.3 Licence

The specification is released under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public Licence.
You are not free to release any specification which uses the Open Preservation Foundation name or branding. The rights to the Open Preservation Foundation name and branding belongs to the Open Preservation Foundation.

## 3 Appraisal and Migration Paths

If a file format is not covered in the section “4 File Format Policies”, then this file format is not considered suitable as an AIP file format. In the case of conversion using sections "4.3 Mark-up languages" and section "4.4 Static File Formats", an appraisal of the significant properties must be made prior to conversion to assess and document the possible data loss.

As mentioned in “2.2 Scope”, this specification does not specify which file formats to submit data to an organisation in. It is up to this institution to determine their policy for how data are submitted to them. However, this specification does specify which file formats may be used for archival storage of spreadsheets, potentially in parallel with bit preservation of an original master copy of the data.

The original master copy may be corrupt or password protected, and hence a migration copy for archival storage cannot be created. It is up to the receiving organisation to appraise, whether these master copies should be preserved or destroyed.

## 4 File Format Policies

Each file format policy has a table with:
* ID is a unique identifier for the requirement
* Name is a short title for the requirement
* Description is the detailed explanation of the requirement including the level of conformance
* Cardinality is the detailing of occurrences of the requirement

The file format policies must be validated in accordance with the following levels of requirements adopted from Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels (Bradner, 1997):
* ERROR is equal to **MUST**/**MUST NOT** conformance
* WARNING is equal to **SHOULD**/**SHOULD NOT** conformance
* INFO is equal to **MAY** conformance

The following subsections cover each file format policy.

### 4.1 OpenDocument Spreadsheets

### 4.3 Mark-up Languages

The following table describes the requirements for data quality, when preserving spreadsheets in a text-based mark-up language file format.

***Be aware!***
*Significant properties may be lost when converting spreadsheets to CSV file format. Examples of properties are pivot tables, images, charts, formulas and formatting. Converting to CSV should therefore only be used after careful appraisal.*

### 4.4 Static File Formats

The following table describes the requirements for data quality, when preserving spreadsheets in a static file format.

***Be aware!***
*Significant properties may be lost when converting spreadsheets to a static file format. Examples of properties are formulas, hyperlinks and dynamic content such as pivot tables, searching and filtering. Converting to a static file format should therefore only be used after careful appraisal.*

## 5 Guidelines for File Format Policies Compliance

This specification includes guidelines on how to comply with the file format policies in section 3. Guidelines are recommended approaches on how to obtain compliance, but many other approaches than specified in these guidelines may exist, especially over time. The guidelines do not specify which tools to use to obtain compliance with the file format policies.

Each file format policy has a guideline with a table containing:
* ID is a unique identifier for the requirement
* Description is the detailed explanation of the guideline

The following subsections go through each guideline and at the end has a section on considerations related to appraisal and migration paths for spreadsheets.

### 5.1 OpenDocument Spreadsheets

The following table gives guidelines for how to comply with the requirements in section 4.1.

**Table 5. OpenDocument Spreadsheets guidelines**

| ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ODS_1 | The password can be manually obtained and input to unlock and resave the file without password protection. Obtaining the password may involve searching through records management systems, other registries or asking the creator of the file.<br><br>When the password for a protected file cannot be obtained, then the spreadsheet cannot be migrated to a preservation format. Your organisation might preserve the original submission or you may instead decide against preserving material that is effectively encrypted. |
| ODS_2 | File format compliance should be validated using a tool, since the manual inspection of each property is an unfeasible task for any human. |
| ODS_3 | Extension should be lowercase. |
| ODS_4 | Any external data references such as data connections, RTD functions, cell references or objects can be removed, however the calculated cell value MUST be preserved.<br><br>Removal of data connections will not result in any risk in loss of calculated cell values.<br><br>Removal of RealTimeData functions and cell references by removing the underlying formula must happen by simultaneously preserving the calculated cell value.<br><br>External object references may be included as an independent object and child/parent relationships created. Thirdly, external object references can be removed with an appraised acceptance of the data loss.<br><br> Cell hyperlinks are exempt and covered in ODS_11.<br><br> Removed external data can be saved as metadata in a sidecar file or in an associated table, to document its existence before removal. |
| ODS_5 | Embedded objects can be converted to a file format, your organisation accepts. Secondly, embedded objects can be removed with an appraised acceptance of the data loss. |
| ODS_6 | A spreadsheet without any cell values or objects is most likely empty of content. To easily check this, read the “meta.xml” and check if “meta:cell-count” or “meta:object-count” is greater than 0.<br><br>If no cell values or objects exist, the file must be appraised to determine if other kind of content exists. If so the file may be preserved.<br><br>Information may be stored in user defined properties or color formatting of cells may have been used to semantically convey a message. These are potential occurences, which after appraisal could lead to preserving the spreadsheet. |
| ODS_7 | Macros contain programming code that can execute and manipulate data in the spreadsheet and the file system. These may present security risks, and it is therefore prudent to remove any macros. Removal may result in loss of information, but typically macros are used to change data, and this goes against the intentions of preserving the data fixed in time, and removal may therefore often happen with no implications. |
| ODS_8 | An OpenDocument file may be marked as “read only” in the file’s XML attribute “LoadReadonly” in “settings.xml”. This means the data won’t be editable unless a copy is created. |
| ODS_9 | Printer settings are information related to local and/or network printers. This data may contain encrypted information on how to connect to the printer. For security reasons, this data may be removed. Removing the data will not result in the loss of any significant properties. |
| ODS_10 | Metadata in the file property information and “meta.xml” such as author, title, category and user defined properties etc. can be misleading if i.e. the document was reused as a template. User defined custom properties may be created and stored in “meta.xml”.<br><br>You may consider removing this information from the file to not mislead any future user of the data.<br><br>Metadata can be saved in a sidecar file or in an associated table, to document their existence before removal. |
| ODS_11 | Cell hyperlinks are in essence unproblematic to keep in a spreadsheet, but your organisation may want to remove cell hyperlinks, since they reference external information.<br><br>Cell hyperlinks may be opened using an internet archive, if the cell hyperlinks are no longer active.<br><br>Broken (unavailable URL) cell hyperlinks may be checked for upon ingest and reported.<br><br>Cell hyperlinks can be saved in a sidecar file or in an associated table, to document their existence before removal. |

### 5.2 Office Open XML SpreadsheetML

The following table gives guidelines for how to comply with the requirements in section 4.2.

**Table 6. Office Open XML SpreadsheetML guidelines**

| ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| OOXML_1 | The password can manually be obtained and input to unlock and resave the file without password protection. Obtaining the password may involve searching through records management systems, other registries or asking the creator of the file. If the password cannot be obtained the spreadsheet should not be preserved. |
| OOXML_2 | File format compliance should be validated using a tool, since the manual inspection of each property is an unfeasible task for any human. |
| OOXML_3 | Extension should be lowercase.<br><br>Extension “.xlam” is not allowed, since this data are an “macro-enabled workbook add-in” and only contains technical data, that changes or enhances the interface and functionality of the rendering application i.e. Excel. Extension ".xlsb" is not allowed since this is a binary file format. |
| OOXML_4 | Conformance may be “transitional” but should be “strict”. Conforming to “strict” involves converting or removing any legacy features imported from older Excel file formats i.e. .xls and .xlt. If a spreadsheet was created as an OOXML spreadsheet, the conformance will by default be “transitional”. However, this spreadsheet will not contain any legacy features and will de facto conform to “strict” and to obtain “strict” conformance only conformance class workbook attribute and namespaces must be changed.<br><br>At the time of writing of this specification tool support for conversion and validation of Strict is poorly supported. |
| OOXML_5 | Any external data references such as data connections, RTD functions, cell references or objects can be removed, however the calculated cell value MUST be preserved.<br><br>Removal of data connections will not result in any risk in loss of calculated cell values.<br><br>Removal of RealTimeData functions and cell references by removing the underlying formula must happen by simultaneously preserving the calculated cell value.<br><br>External object references may be included as an independent object and child/parent relationships created. Thirdly, external object references can be removed with an appraised acceptance of the data loss.<br><br>Cell hyperlinks are exempt and covered in OOXML_13.<br><br>Removed external data can be saved as metadata in a sidecar file or in an associated table, to document its existence before removal. |
| OOXML_6 | Embedded objects can be converted to a file format, your organisation accepts. Secondly, embedded objects can be removed with an appraised acceptance of the data loss. |
| OOXML_7 | A spreadsheet without any cell values may still contain images, charts and other objects. However, if any cell values does not exist this may be an indicator, that the spreadsheet is empty and therefore should be assessed, if this is the case. If empty, the spreadsheet should not be preserved. |
| OOXML_8 | Macros contain programming code that can execute and manipulate data in the spreadsheet and the file system. This may have security risks, and it is therefore prudent to remove any macros. Removal may result in loss of information, but typically macros are used to change data, and this goes against the intentions of preserving the data fixed in time, and removal may therefore often happen with no implications.<br><br>Removing macros happens by converting the spreadsheet from “.xlsm” or “.xltm” to “.xlsx”. |
| OOXML_9 | Absolute filepath value in the XML attribute “x15ac:absPath” in “workbook.xml” may contain personal or confidential information in the naming of folders/directories of the file system, which the file was last opened and saved to.<br><br>Absolute filepath can be removed without loss of any significant properties.<br><br>Absolute filepath can be saved in a sidecar file or in an associated table, to document its existence before removal. |
| OOXML_10 | An OOXML file may be marked as “final”. |
| OOXML_11 | Printer settings are information related to local printers or printer on the network. This information may contain encrypted information on how to connect to the printer. For security reasons, this data may be removed. Removing the data will not result in the loss of any significant properties. |
| OOXML_12 | Metadata in the file property information such as author, title, category etc. can be misleading if i.e. the document was reused as a template. You may consider removing this information from the file to not mislead any future user of the data.<br><br>Metadata can be saved in a sidecar file or in an associated table, to document their existence before removal. |
| OOXML_13 | Cell hyperlinks are in essence unproblematic to keep in a spreadsheet, but your organisation may want to remove cell hyperlinks, since they reference external information.<br><br>Cell hyperlinks may be opened using an internet archive, if the cell hyperlinks are no longer active.<br><br>Broken (unavailable URL) cell hyperlinks may be checked for upon ingest and reported.<br><br>Cell hyperlinks can be saved in a sidecar file or in an associated table, to document their existence before removal. |

### 5.3 Mark-up Languages

The following table gives guidelines for how to comply with the requirements in section 4.3.

**Table 7. Mark-up language guidelines**

| ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CSV_1 | File format compliance should be validated using a tool, since the manual inspection of each property is an unfeasible task for any human. |
| CSV_2 | Extension should be lowercase. |
| CSV_3 | It is necessary to preserve each sheet in a spreadsheet, therefore you must make sure to export each sheet manually, or if applying a programmatic solution to loop all the sheets for exporting. The name of the sheet must be given “Sheet1.csv”, “Sheet2.csv” etc. |
| CSV_4 | The file format of the graphical material should be any appropriate image file format, your organisation already has a file format policy for, or a new file format policy should be created. |

### 5.4 Static File Formats

 The following table gives guidelines for how to comply with the requirements in section 4.4.

**Table 8. Static file format guidelines**

| ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| STATIC_1 | You must choose one of these file formats to preserve a static representation of the spreadsheet in: JPEG-2000, PDF/A, PNG or TIFF file formats. A wide range of other image file formats exists, but these are typically not used for preservation of data, unless the data was originally created in the file format.<br><br>This specification limits the number of possible file formats to use for preserving a static representation of the spreadsheet, because it is necessary to specify exact file formats, otherwise it is not possible to validate the file format. Simply stating that “your organisation must use any static file format, that your organisation has a file format policy for” is not sufficient, because it is not feasible for software validation workflows to universally validate any possible static file format. |
| STATIC_2 | Extension should be lowercase. |
| STATIC_3 | It is necessary to preserve each sheet in a spreadsheet, therefore you must make sure to export each sheet manually, or if applying a programmatic solution to loop all the sheets for exporting. It is up to your organisation to determine if sheets should be split into multiple export files, or if you combine them into a single multipage file. When using a single multipage file, each page must have the name of the sheet in it. This specification does not recommend one approach over the other, and if your organisation does not have any preference, you may allow both approaches. |
| STATIC_4 | Before exporting, you must applying text wrapping to all cells of the sheet, otherwise truncated cells with information will result in information loss, since this information will be hidden behind the proceeding column’s cell, if this cell contains information. |
| STATIC_5 | The new static file representation of the formulas should have three columns in row 1 with the following information:<ul><li>*Column 1:* Sheet name</li><li>*Column 2:* Cell reference</li><li>*Column 3:* Formula</li></ul> |
| STATIC_6 | The static file representation of the cell hyperlinks should be shared with the file created in STATIC_5 and have a fourth column appended in row 1 with the following information:<ul><li>*Column 4:* Cell hyperlink</li></ul> |

## 7 Glossary

Table with terms used in the specification.

**Table 14. Glossary**

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Archival Information Package (AIP)** | *From OAIS:* An Information Package, consisting of the Content Information and the associated Preservation Description Information (PDI), which is preserved within an OAIS. |
| **Artefact** | An artefact is a data object in a spreadsheet which is not a significant property and hence not important for future reuse of the spreadsheet, but removing the object may not be considered neither necessary nor worthwhile. Therefore, the data object may remain in the spreadsheet and considered unnecessary for rendering or future migration. |
| **Appraisal** | A preservation assessment to determine whether or not the data should be preserved. |
| **Cell** | A spreadsheet consists of sheets, which consist of cells. The cell is the minimal structure for storing computational data in a spreadsheet. A cell has an address composed of the column and row ids i.e. A1 is the address of the first cell on a sheet, and is composed of column A and row 1. |
| **Compliance** | In this context, compliance means to abide by any requirement set in a specification or standard. |
| **Conformance** | Conformance is any defined differentiation in a specification. This means the number or definition of requirements of the specification may be stricter at one conformance level over another conformance level. |
| **CSV** | Abbreviation of Comma-separated values. File format used to data exchange of datasets with tabular data. |
| **Data connections** | Data connections in a spreadsheet is a type of connection, which can connect to an external database or file to feed and update cell values. |
| **Designated community** | *From OAIS:* An identified group of potential Consumers who should be able to understand a particular set of information. The Designated Community may be composed of multiple user communities. A Designated Community is defined by the Archive and this definition may change over time. |
| **Embedded objects** | An object embedded in the file/package i.e. an image, another spreadsheet or 3D object. |
| **External cell references** | External cell references is a type of cell formula, which fetches data from another spreadsheet. |
| **External objects** | An object that is linked as an OLE object, but is not embedded into the file/package. |
| **Macros** | A sequence of code, which the spreadsheet can execute. This code may change data in the spreadsheet or the operating system. |
| **Mark-up language** | A mark-up language is a structured and text-encoded model for annotating data. CSV and HTML are mark-up languages. |
| **Migration path** | The chosen output file format for an input file format in a data conversion process. The migration path should to do the widest possible extent preserve all the significant properties of the input file format. Methodical assessments are necessary to define acceptable migration paths. |
| **OAIS** | The Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System, ISO 14721 |
| **Office Open XML (OOXML)** | Office Open XML ECMA- and ISO-standard. |
| **OpenDocument Spreadsheets (ODS)** | OpenDocument Spreadsheet subset of the OpenDocument ISO-standard. |
| **Printer settings** | Printer settings contains information on registered printers available for printing. This may contain encrypted information about connecting to the printer. |
| **Protection** | A spreadsheet may have read and/or write protection on structure, sheets and/or cells, that may demand a password to enable reading and/or writing. |
| **RealTimeData functions (RTD)** | RealTimeData functions is a type of cell formula in an OOXML spreadsheet, which can fetch data from a server in a specified interval. |
| **Sheets** | A spreadsheet must contain at least one sheet but may contain a large number of sheets. Sheets are the “pages” of a spreadsheet, and any cell exists in a sheet. Sheets are the structural wrapper of spreadsheet data. |
| **Significant properties** | Significant properties are the properties of data, which a designated community has deemed important to preserve for future reuse of data. A significant property is also termed a “Transformational Information Property” in the OAIS. |
| **Static file format** | A static file format is typically an image file format or the PDF file format, which editable files are converted to. This may result in loss of significant properties and hence data quality. |
| **Validation** | Validation is the act of confirming something, and in this context a spreadsheet, conforms to the regulations specified in a document, typically referred to as a standard. Validation results in either an approval or a disapproval of any data property or attribute according to a chosen conformance level.<br><br>Validation processes should be supported by software to automate the process, but validation may involve manual inspection of the data. |

This specification draws inspiration from and is a natural by-product of the Open Preservation Foundation’s discontinued Archives Interest Group (AIG), which in the years 2016-21 investigated the significant properties of spreadsheets. The group won the audience award for best poster at the international digital preservation conference iPRES in 2019 and published their work in a final report in 2021, which also was presented as a paper at iPRES the same year.
