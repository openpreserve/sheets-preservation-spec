## 1 Introduction

Each file format policy has a table with:
* ID is a unique identifier for the requirement
* Name is a short title for the requirement
* Description is the detailed explanation of the requirement including the level of conformance
* Cardinality is the detailing of occurrences of the requirement

The file format policies must be validated in accordance with the following levels of requirements adopted from Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels (Bradner, 1997):
* ERROR is equal to **MUST**/**MUST NOT** conformance
* WARNING is equal to **SHOULD**/**SHOULD NOT** conformance
* INFO is equal to **MAY** conformance

## 2 Policies

The following subsections cover each file format policy.

### 2.1 OpenDocument Spreadsheets

| ODS_13 | Cell hyperlinks | The file **MAY** have cell hyperlinks. |

## 2.3 Mark-up Languages

The following table describes the requirements for data quality, when preserving spreadsheets in a text-based mark-up language file format.

***Be aware!***
*Significant properties may be lost when converting spreadsheets to CSV file format. Examples of properties are pivot tables, images, charts, formulas and formatting. Converting to CSV should therefore only be used after careful appraisal.*

**Table 3. Mark-up language requirements**

| ID | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSV_1 | CSV file format | The file **MUST** comply with the specification “Common Format and MIME Type for Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files, RFC 4180”. |
| CSV_2 | Extension | The file **MUST** have extension “.csv”. |
| CSV_3 | Sheets | The spreadsheet **MUST** have each sheet converted to an independent file named “Sheet1”, “Sheet2” etc. |
| CSV_4 | Graphical material | The spreadsheet **MAY** have any graphical material i.e. images, charts, diagrams, shapes extracted as independent files named “Image1”, “Image2” etc. |

## 2.4 Static File Formats

The following table describes the requirements for data quality, when preserving spreadsheets in a static file format.

***Be aware!***
*Significant properties may be lost when converting spreadsheets to a static file format. Examples of properties are formulas, hyperlinks and dynamic content such as pivot tables, searching and filtering. Converting to a static file format should therefore only be used after careful appraisal.*

**Table 4. Static file formats requirements**

| ID | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| STATIC_1 | File format | The file **MUST** comply with one of these file format specifications.<ul><li>JPEG-2000</li><li>PDF/A</li><li>PNG</li><li>TIFF</li></ul> |
| STATIC_2 | Extension | The file **MUST** have one of these extensions.<ul><li>“.jp2”</li><li>“.pdf”</li><li>“.png”</li><li>“.tif” or “.tiff”</li></ul> |
| STATIC_3 | Sheets | The spreadsheet **MUST** have each sheet converted to an independent file named “Sheet1”, “Sheet2” etc. |
| STATIC_4 | Truncated cells | Any truncated cells **MUST NOT** have text wrap. |
| STATIC_5 | Formulas | The spreadsheet **MUST** have any formulas printed to a static file named “Data”. |
| STATIC_6 | Cell hyperlinks | The spreadsheet **SHOULD** have any cell hyperlinks printed to a static file named “Data”. |
